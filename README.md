Simple simulation, living on a grid. How a culture of cells is living. It handles , which cells are dead and living. 
How does it works:
-Counting all living  neighbours, each cell is counting their neighbours(8). How many are alive from them? 
Example. N= Number of the living Neighbour cells. Max 8  min 0.
Rule:
The cell is going to die if its less then two. 
The Cell is also dying if there are three or more.
If the field is empty. And if N is equal three, therefore the cell is going to be created on the field.


Cells and Situation was created with canvas. Called as drawplace in my project. Technology which is used is WPF.
